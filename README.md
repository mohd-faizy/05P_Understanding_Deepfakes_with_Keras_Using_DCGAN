## Task 1: Introduction

    - Introduction to the DCGANS

## Task 2: Importing and Plotting the Data

    - Importing the MNIST Dataset
    - Creating a subset of the dataset for just one class.
    - Visualizing the subset.

## Task 3: Discriminator

    - Basic understanding of how a GAN works.
    - Creating a Discriminator Network.
    - Creating an optimizer instance.

## Task 4: Generator

    - Creating a Generator Network.
    - Generating a new image from the untrained Generator model.

## Task 5: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

    - Connecting the Generator and Discriminator to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

## Task 6: Training the GAN

    - Creating a training loop.
    - Creating a dynamic plot that displays generated images after each epoch.
